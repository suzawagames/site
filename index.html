      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>Suzawa Games is an up-and-coming Indie Game Studio heavily inspired by the Japanese style of storytelling seemingly unique to its media. Suzawa is made up of a group of college friends that shared an interest and created a club around it. Now we want to give back and create something for the community. We are proud to announce <b>Mid-Spring Festival</b>. Below you will find some brief details on our upcoming game. It is still early on in development so details may be subject to change...</p>

      <h2>Mid-Spring Festival</h2>
      <p>Mid-Spring Festival will be a PC visual-novel featuring dynamic backgrounds, animated cutscenes, and dynamic 2D character models. We are also aiming for the possibility of console releases with hopes for PS4, Switch, and the Vita. Seeing as the project is still early on in development, a Vita release may not be possible due to its discontinued support, but if possible we would still like to push forward for the beloved Vita platform.</p>
      <p>Taking place in a rural onsen town in the mountains, it's that time of year again. It's time to go back home. But it's not just any visit, it's of course time for the yearly Mid-Spring Festival! Enjoy the festivities, catch up with old friends, and most importantly... use the onsen! Just who might you meet on your trip back home? And what's this...? A new town mayor? What awaits this peaceful village with the turning of time?!</p>
